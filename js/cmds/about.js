Hi, I'm Rounak, a self-taught web developer from India. I've been coding since 2018 and have experience with Node.js, web development, and Linux. As a student, I love spending my free time coding and experimenting with new technologies. My interests include machine learning, low-level systems, and circuitry. I'm an introvert by nature and prefer to spend most of my time working on personal projects. Thanks for taking the time to learn a little more about me!\n
